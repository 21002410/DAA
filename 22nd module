Question text
Create a Python program to find longest common substring or subword (LCW) of two strings using dynamic programming with bottom-up approach.

A string r is a substring or subword of a string s if r is contained within s. A string r is a common substring of s and t if r is a substring of both s and t. A string r is a longest common substring or subword (LCW) of s and t if there is no string that is longer than r and is a common substring of s and t. The problem is to find an LCW of two given strings.

For example:

Test	Input	Result
lcw(u, v)
bisect
trisect
Longest Common Subword: isect
Answer:(penalty regime: 0 %)
Feedback
