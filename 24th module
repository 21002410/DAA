Question text
You are given a rows x cols matrix grid representing a field of cherries where grid[i][j] represents the number of cherries that you can collect from the (i, j) cell.

You have two robots that can collect cherries for you:

Robot #1 is located at the top-left corner (0, 0), and
Robot #2 is located at the top-right corner (0, cols - 1).
Return the maximum number of cherries collection using both robots by following the rules below:

From a cell (i, j), robots can move to cell (i + 1, j - 1), (i + 1, j), or (i + 1, j + 1).
When any robot passes through a cell, It picks up all cherries, and the cell becomes an empty cell.
When both robots stay in the same cell, only one takes the cherries.
Both robots cannot move outside of the grid at any moment.
Both robots should reach the bottom row in grid.

For example:

Rat In A Maze Problem
You are given a maze in the form of a matrix of size n * n. Each cell is either clear or blocked denoted by 1 and 0 respectively. A rat sits at the top-left cell and there exists a block of cheese at the bottom-right cell. Both these cells are guaranteed to be clear. You need to find if the rat can get the cheese if it can move only in one of the two directions - down and right. It can’t move to blocked cells.

                                             

Provide the solution for the above problem Consider n=4)

The output (Solution matrix) must be 4*4 matrix with value "1" which indicates the path to destination and "0" for the cell indicating the absence of the path to destination.

Question text
Given a 2D matrix tsp[][], where each row has the array of distances from that indexed city to all the other cities and -1 denotes that there doesn’t exist a path between those two indexed cities. The task is to print minimum cost in TSP cycle.

tsp[][] = {{-1, 30, 25, 10}, 
{15, -1, 20, 40}, 
{10, 20, -1, 25},
